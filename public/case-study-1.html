        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Creating tech content and writing case studies</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center;">During my time as a Marketing Intern at UATG, my main roles were to manage and produce all public content.</p>

    <section id="case-studies" style="background-color: #f6f9fa; padding: 40px 0;">

                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        I helped produced over 15 case studies of the company's previous projects, with solutions ranging from LED walls, conference technology, as well as lobby audio/visual systems. My role were to prepare case studies and publish it onto our company website. To achieve this, I was in charge of taking photos of our solutions, editing these images, as well as writing the descriptions for each case study. The description details what the client requested, what technology did we install, how our solution ressolved our client's problem, as well as an overview of the effective features of our solution. These case studies are written with past or potential customers in mind, showcasing UATG's excellence with completed projects as well as trying to promote our solutions to any interested customers who may be seeking for audio/visual solutions.

                        Having supported all outward-facing content during my time at UATG, I also produced 10+ company newsletters that showcased what the company has been doing recently. My main objective was to engage with client values and help improve our company's brand image through showcasing our awards, certifications, as well as some of our continious efforts to give back to the community through volunteering or supporting in public health and environmental initiatives.

                          <p style="text-align: left;">
                            Given that UATG is an audio/visual consultant company, another main responsibility of my role were to create graphics that also helps promote the brand and products of our partnered tech companies (Creston, Poly, Microsoft Teams, LG, Zoom, Samsung, etc.). I was in charge of creating graphics that showcased and marketed the capabilities of specific products of our partners, such as the Creston Flex Video Conferencing or the Poly G7500. Through promoting the products of our vendors, not only are we showing that we at UATG only uses the best audio/visual technology, but it also additionally serves to maintain strong relations with the company's partners through marketing their business.

                              <p style="text-align: left; max-width: 750px;">Additionally, I also helped produce a video that showcases one of UATG's partner called MyBooking. Given the increasing rate of international companies having offices in Hong Kong, it was imperative to amp up our efforts in marketing to all English-speaking clients as well. I was involved throughout the entire production process, from storyboarding, script-writing, filming, editing, to starring and narrating in the video. This video aimed to be beneficial for expanding our clientele, as well as further establishing our relations to one of the company's partners.
