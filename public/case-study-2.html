  <div class="container">
    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Research, data analysis, and data-driven marketing</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;">During my time as a Marketing Intern at UATG, I worked intensively with data to evaluate and improve our digital campaigns.</p>

  <div style="background-color: #f6f9fa; width: 100%; padding: 10px 0;">

      <h2 style="text-align: left;">Google Ads & Google Analytics:</h2>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        One of my main tasks at UATG was to set up and figure out how to put Google Ads to use. When I started, our Google Ads score was at a rating of 67, meaning that our usage of our budget is ineffective and inefficient. To increase our expected CTR, I improved and concise keywords for our most important sites, included ad copy such as "free shipping" or "free consultation", implemented images on our sites when searched on Google, as well as implementing a clear call-to-action or ad extensions to make our sites stand out. This resulted in a score of 83, as well as improving our expected CTR by 38% and our RPM by 14%. Moreover, I was able to achieve these outcomes with a limited budget and ensuring that our money is being allocated in an efficient and outcome-oriented way.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        I was also involved in working with Google Analytics to identify how users reach our site, how many of these are returning or new users, what our most visited pages are, what are the most sought after products/services that users reach out to us for, as well as what campaigns we have ongoing when these users click our sites. From this, I was able to evaluate our current media setup and digital campaigns, allowing me to improve, streamline, and suggest new improvements to help boost our marketing initiatives.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">
        A core identification I made when using Google Analytics was that users tend to click on our sites that offer products made by environmentally committed companies. Therefore, I designed a simple survey that was sent to all of our subscribers of our newsletter and past customers. This short survey done over 3 weeks revealed that customers care extremely about environmental efforts and often deter from companies that don't show commitment or have a poor history with eco-friendliness. Thus, I began to implement an initiative to earn a government-recognised certification called Wastewi$e HK, which evaluates Hong Kong office culture and their commitment to eco-friendly practices. Through this process, I supported in creating in-office initiatives such as implementing environmental training and education sessions, replacing most waste bins with recycling bins, and creating reminders to reduce usage of electricity and paper. The certification would not only prove to our current and potential clients that we at UATG are committed to protecting the planet, but also align our customer's values with how we conduct business with the intent of generating trust and improving our brand image.

        <p style="flex: 1; text-align: left;">
          As a Sociology undergraduate, I have worked intensively with data for numerous research or policy oriented papers. 
          Particularly, I am proficient with creating surveys and utilizing Excel or SPSS to help manage data, analyse trends, 
          and create visualisations. Moreover, my unending passion to learn and continuously grow has led me to stay in touch with my 
          skills through conducting yearly Google Ads and Google Analytics courses, as well as gaining certifications on new tools like 
          NodeJS and Contentful.
