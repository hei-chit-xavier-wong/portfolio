                        <p style="flex: 1; text-align: left;">
                          I helped plan, organise, and executed over 10 events targeted at students, with turn outs ranging from 40-120 participants. 
                          These duties include planning and leading games, assisting sports competitions, icebreakers, to board games and movie nights. 
                          The goal was to create and foster a community where everyone feels welcome and at home regardless of where they may be from. 
                          We aimed to gain revenue through memberships and ticket prices to fund our future projects and events for our members, thus it 
                          was imperative that each event was engaging and participants leave with a positive experience. Moreover, I also supported with 
                          photo taking at events that helps HKSA to then market our events and overall brand image.

  <div style="flex: 1;">
    <p style="text-align: left;">
      I have outreached to over 80+ companies and organisations in hopes of setting up a collaboration between their business and HKSA. From this, I have supported in acquiring 4 major sponsorships who continuously supplied food, desserts, and drinks for many of our participants and members at our events. In trade, we promoted their business' to our large student community, which resulted in significant increase in social media following for our sponsors, and therefore potential revenue.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: left;">
      As someone that loves to cook and eat, I understand the strong motivations food can have on people, particularly university students. Therefore, my commitment and strategy was to aim to acquire food items that we could distribute, which not only attracted more engagement to our events, but also allowed us to provide a more positive experience for students who do turn up.

        <h2 style="text-align: left;">FeedingHK:</h2>

        <p style="text-align: left;">
            In Hong Kong, bakeries have a common practice of throwing away bread that they fail to sell by the end of the day despite it being completely food safe to consume for another couple of days. My role as a Bread Runner for FeedingHK involved supporting the outreach program which worked with 200+ local bakeries to establish partnership to help redistribute leftover food to shelters and community centres. Not only are we offering to resolve their "disposable waste" issue, but we also ensure that these food items are being dispersed to those who may need it the most.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            Moreover, I was most involved with maintaining relations with our partners, providing them with awards and certificates that proves their continious support to our charity. Furthermore, we would also help them promote their business' during our community events and fundraisers in return for their support as a collaborator. I also supported the volunteer training packages, ensuring that all volunteers who sign up to help know what to do when collecting these food items, and where to deliver them.
        </p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">
                Growing up in an Asian household, I always had a great relationship with food. I was taught at a young age to always be grateful for the food on the table, and never let anything go to waste. Therefore, I was increadibly passionate at the opportunity to work with Feeding HK, as not only was I able to put one of my  core values to practice, but also be able to do it to help those who are less fortunate than me.
